<ul>
<li>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</li>
</ul>
<p>The client is a driver&rsquo;s training company named DriverPass that wants to provide a program to prepare new drivers to pass their DMV test. DriverPass wants to manage the training activity such as scheduling sessions, recording student progress, and other non-driving requirements with a web-base application that does not require installation.</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you do particularly well?</li>
</ul>
<p>I captured the top-down process well. There are places for improvement, but I attempted to focus on what was needed done for the business process without going into implementation details of a developer.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think my UML diagram strikes the right balance of capturing the application as a whole without going into too much detail. The diagram is too busy and should probable be simplified, summarized, and broken into sub-diagrams for more detail of each major process.</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you interpret the user&rsquo;s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user&rsquo;s needs when designing?</li>
</ul>
<p>First, I tried to keep a perspective from the &ldquo;business&rdquo; view in capturing functional requirements. I then expanded this to a more role base view in trying to flesh out the business processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</li>
</ul>
<p>I try to capture what, why, and how for the application starting at the top. I repeat this dividing each task until only simple tasks remain.</p>
